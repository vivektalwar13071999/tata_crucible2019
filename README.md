The smart city initiative from government of India has triggered lots of enthusiasm among the passionate innovators across India. In the imagination of any city dweller in India, the picture of a smart city contains a wish list of infrastructure and services that describes his or her level of aspiration. To provide for the aspirations and needs of the citizens, urban planners ideally aim at developing the entire urban eco-system, which is represented by the four pillars of comprehensive development-institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure. This can be a long-term goal and cities can work towards developing such comprehensive infrastructure incrementally, adding on layers of ‘smartness’. 

In an attempt to provide comfort to the people, we are exploring solutions to identify and reduce noise levels in the city. In addition, safety also becomes important and illumination levels during the night times in the city needs to be measured and maintained. Potholes are another big cause of inconvenience on the roads. They contribute to accidents, traffic jams and vehicle damages.

It becomes a challenge when the information on lux levels and dB levels are not known. Also, keeping roads in good condition is a challenging problem as harsh weather, unexpected traffic load, and normal wear and tear affects the road quality and degrade even well-laid roads over relatively short periods of time. Currently it is a challenge to measure these parameters across the city and also map it on the google map. Therefore, the detection, monitoring and mapping of noise levels, lux levels and the severity of potholes become very crucial for the safety and driving experience for the commuters as well as city-dwellers. The city planning authorities will be immensely benefitted with this information as they can fix the burnt-out lights, work on reducing dB levels and quickly repair the potholes.

The solution must meet the following requirements:

It should track and monitor the potholes along with their size and severity.
Lux levels, dB levels and potholes data visualization and representation on google maps.
Dynamic alerts generation on the map – green in safe zones and red when the readings cross the limits predefined.
An optimal route map should be created based on the severity of road damage or noise levels or illumination levels.
It should be capable of handling data from multiple sources for the same road and    aggregate it without any errors.
It should alert the authorities via SMS and email in cases where the data crosses the threshold size and/or are not repaired even after a certain stipulated time frame.
It should be convenient to use.
It should not report any false positives.
The information captured by sensors should be made available to all participants/users.
